# Docker Wordpress Development

This image is a good starting point for developing wordpress themes and plugins.
It shows php's errors so that you can find bugs and it has XDebug so that you can debug your code via webstorm / intellij.
There are two versions, either you want to use composer as a base for your development, or you want a vanilla wordpress.

> **NOTE** This is not intended to be used in production. It is intended to be used as a dev setup for those creating themes / plugins.

## PHP 7
Both the vanilla and composer versions are running on php 7
PHP has show all errors enables for simpler debugging

## XDebug
Xdebug 2.8 is installed and configured to listen to port `9999` and the IDEKey `docker`


# Usage

## Vanilla Wordpress
Uses wordpress own base image, but adds xdebug and debugging variables
Check the [Example](example) directory for usage instructions

## Composer Wordpress
Uses composer as a base for development, which installs wordpress via composer into /wp
It has a couple of workarounds to get it working with nginx.
Check the [Composer Example](composer-example) directory for usage instructions

# Backend Proxying
If you need to override a certain url and proxy to another backend you can include your own nginx conf which will be included along side the
wordpress nginx config
Check [include file](example/docker-nginx.conf) and [mapping](example/docker-compose.yml#L41) for how this is accomplished

# Access MariaDB (MySql)
To access mysql you use a database program such as Navicat or Sequel Pro.
```
host: localhost
port: 3306
user: root
password: 42
```
you can now use Navicats data transfer functionality to copy a existing db into docker.

# Development
to update to latest versions of wordpress and nginx run update script

get new version of xdebug
go to `https://xdebug.org/download` and download sources for the php version we want to support
also copy the sha 256 hash to add to the Dockerfile for wordpress and composer-wordpress

```
./update.sh

```
